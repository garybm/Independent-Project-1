# Portafolio-Landing-Page
This is the first Independent Project for the Epicodus Intro class, 01/11/2018

#### By Gary Bermudez

## Description

This is the first Epicodus independent project. I did a Portafolio landing page using CSS, HTML and linking a Bootstrap application. The objectives of this projects are to use the most common HTML tags:p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, span. Use Bootstrap classes to style your page and create a custom-made stylesheet that uses cascading, the box model, and floats.
